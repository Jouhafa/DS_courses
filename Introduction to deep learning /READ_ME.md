## Read me : 
This course was deliverd by @Charles Ollion, and the support for this week was the github repository https://github.com/m2dsupsdlclass/lectures-labs.

However, We didn't go through all the parts of the course neither the slides nor the labs.

The highlights of the course were :
- General Introduction to Deep Learning
- Backpropagation
- CNNs
- Object Detection and Image Segmentation

P.S : At the end of the week each one chooses a deep learning paper and try to understand it and after present to everyone with a code implementation of some of the parts of the paper. For my case, i worked on the paper of "ResNet50 Strikes back..."
